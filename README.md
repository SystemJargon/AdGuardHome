<b>Update Frequency:</b>

A date and time stamp should be added to the list/s at the top to show, "last updated". 

Currently this is daily just after 12pm NZT time (+12 hours ahead of UTC) for my "dynamic" lists. It is automated.

## Notes about this Repo:

This is a relatively new repo, most of my lists etc. I've worked on lately are in Pi-hole.

If you are looking for <b>Pi-hole</b> resources, lists, how-to's, refer to my [Pi-hole repository](https://github.com/lz-eng/pi-hole).
